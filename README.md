Module 3 Challenge Repository
In this challenge we analyzed financial budget data and election vote results. With the budget data we needed to find: the total number of months included in the dataset, net profit/loss over the entire period, changes in profit/loss over the entire period (and the average of those changes), The greatest increase in profits (date and amount), and the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount). 
You can find the Financial Analysis results in the Analysis folder located in PyBank.

As for the election data, we were asked to analyze the votes and calculate the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
You can find the Election Results in the Analysis folder located in PyPoll. 

I researched outside examples to figure out a lot of the string concatenation, got it to work in the end
